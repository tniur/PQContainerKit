# PQContainerKit

PQContainerKit – a Swift library that provides APIs for multi-recipient encrypted file containers, powered by post-quantum KEM (ML‑KEM‑768, FIPS 203).

## Status
This project is under active development. APIs, container format details, and behavior may change at any time until the first stable release.

## Important notice (educational / research)
PQContainerKit is an educational and research project. It has not been independently audited and is not intended for protecting real-world sensitive data. Use at your own risk.

## Requirements
- Swift Package Manager (SPM).
- iOS 26+ (CryptoKit ML‑KEM support).

## Security
Please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting guidance.

## Roadmap
- v0.x: API shaping, format prototyping, test harness.
- v1.0.0: stable API + container format v1 + full test plan coverage.
