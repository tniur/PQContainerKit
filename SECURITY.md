# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest released version of PQContainerKit is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Security issues should be reported privately. Do **not** open a public GitHub issue for vulnerabilities.

Preferred channel:
- GitHub Security Advisories (“Report a vulnerability”)

## What to Include
- Affected version (tag/commit)
- Platform details (iOS version, Xcode, Swift)
- Steps to reproduce / PoC
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Impact assessment (what an attacker can achieve)

## Safe Harbor
Good-faith security research is appreciated. Please avoid accessing real user data and use test data only.
